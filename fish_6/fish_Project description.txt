GAME OF NATURE

# Project Description
This project is an interactive game simulating the marine ecosystem and ocean pollution.  
Through a vivid and intuitive approach, users can understand the operation mechanism of 
the marine ecosystem and the serious impact of ocean pollution on it.

Users manipulate "Prey - Small Fish", "Predator - Big Fish", and "Trash" via buttons and
 can adjust the prey's steering behaviors using Separation, Alignment, and Cohesion controls.

In this vivid simulation, green small fish turn white and speed up to escape when spotting 
red big fish, slowing down post-escape;  otherwise, they risk being hunted and disappear.
Big fish accelerate to chase small fish, slowing down post-chase due to energy depletion, 
and only re-energize to hunt after a resting period. Satiated big fish turn yellow and slow 
down to digest. However, big fish die upon encountering garbage.

Simultaneously, as more trash enters, the ocean backdrop darkens, reflecting the grave pollution effects.
